# Image-classification
This is an image classification program built with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It uses TensorFlow (with Keras) to train a CNN with images from the CIFAR-10 dataset and make predictions accordingly. The images are classified into 10 classes - airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
